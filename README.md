# Initial network handshake with bitcoin core node

With the JS/TS background, I consider this project being a huge milestone for the following reasons:

- first low level programming experience (working raw bytes)
- first experience interacting with a bitcoin core node from a code environment
- first experience with Rust programming language

A lot of knowledge gained.

Heavily inspired by [learn me a bitcoin](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/networking/#handshake) tutorial.

## What's next?

Learning to compose a bitcoin transaction, signing it and broadcasting it to the network.
